# Blockchain Capstone Project 

Designed to teach individuals the skills needed to build decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain, this decentralized cryptocurrency exchange allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies using the Ethereum blockchain. 

To buy or sell a cryptocurrency, simply search for the currency you want to trade and place an order on the order book. You can either set a market price or create a limit order at a specific price. Your order will be matched with other orders on the exchange, and the trade will be executed when the conditions of your order are met.

The exchange also features a wallet for each user, which allows you to store your cryptocurrencies safely and securely. You can use your wallet to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies.
